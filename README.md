Task - Need use coroutines for create, change and set color 

Spawn 400 cubes in a square, size [20*20]. Cubes should spawn at intervals of 0.04 seconds (this time should be configurable through the inspector).
Add a button "Change Colors", when clicking on which the cubes one by one with an interval of 0.2 seconds will change their color (each cube should change its color for 0.5 seconds). The interval and time of color change should be configurable through the inspector.
The color in which the cubes will be recolored on clicking the button is chosen randomly, one for all cubes.
